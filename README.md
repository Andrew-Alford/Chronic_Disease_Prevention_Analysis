# CDC Dataset Analysis

This project is a Python-based data analysis project that utilizes two datasets obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The goal of this project is to clean and analyze the CDC datasets, providing valuable insights and visualizations.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: The project includes robust data cleaning procedures to ensure accurate and reliable analysis. It handles missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies, ensuring high-quality data for analysis.

- **Dataset Integration**: The two CDC datasets are seamlessly integrated into the analysis pipeline, allowing for comprehensive comparisons and correlations between the data.

- **Statistical Analysis**: The cleaned datasets undergo various statistical analyses, including descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing. These analyses help uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

- **Visualization**: The project incorporates data visualization techniques to present the analysis results in a visually appealing and understandable manner. It generates insightful charts, graphs, and plots to facilitate data interpretation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the CDC Dataset Analysis project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `Chronic_Disease_Code.py` script to clean the CDC datasets.
4. Execute the `Chronic_Disease_Code.py` script to perform the data analysis and generate visualizations.
5. View the US_Chronic_Disease_Indicators_and_Causes_of_Death_Analysis document for a completed version of the key takeaways.
